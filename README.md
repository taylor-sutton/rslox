This is a Rust implementation of the Bytecode virtual machine from the second part of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). My goal is to write idiomatic Rust, making light modifications to the structure of the book's C code as needed. However, to keep my life simple, I am trying to not make overly drastic structural chnages.
